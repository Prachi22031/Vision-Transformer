# Vision-Transformer

This repository contains an implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model in PyTorch. The Vision Transformer is a deep learning model designed for image classification tasks. 

Model Architecture
Patch Embedding: Splits the image into patches and projects them into an embedding space.
Self-Attention: Computes attention scores to capture relationships between patches.
Transformer Block: Stacks multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks.
Classification Head: Classifies the image based on the embedded class token.
